# Intro

Hi there! Thanks for checking out my repo! 

I'm Ronnie and I currently work at Block as a BI Engingeer.  I've worked in various data industries and roles over my career as a data analyst, data engineer, and currently in the analytics/BI engineering family.  

This repo contains my personal SQL style guide. I've adopted these practices, guidelines, and rules throughout my career based on personal experience, recommendations from peers, and recommendations from best practices shared by other talented analysts and engineers in the data community.

This guide can either be used as is, or as a starting point for discussions on how to format production code. The most important thing to keep in mind is to find common ground and make a decision as a **team** on how you want to format your production code.  I've worked on several data teams, and inhereted many code bases, where too much valuable time is spent trying to understand the previous developer's, or current teammates, intent when reading their code primarily due to readability issues.  

This style guide is intended to ease that pain.  All of the SQL in this style guide can be transposed and used in cloud data warehouse solutions and is intended to be tool agnostic.

Check out these other style guides that have influenced me:
